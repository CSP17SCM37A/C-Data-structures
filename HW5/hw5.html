</center>
<p><ul>
<ul>

<p>Assignment  Goals :<p>
To learn  
<p><ul>
<li>How to implement C++ class with data members are pointers:  constructor , destructor, static member functions, public and private member functions,
overloading operators.
 <li>How to  implement application using class/objects, how to implement function that returns objects.
 <li> Text file output

 </ul>    
<p>For hw6 <p><ol>

<li>  You need to <b><i><u>complete </u></i></b>the implementation of the class <A href="Date.h">Date</a> : <P>


<li>Using Date class to implement a C++ application " Calendar  System ", which has two functions :
<p><ol>
<li>Provides a <a href="List.txt"> list </a> of major holidays and the start/end date of the Day Light Saving Time of  a given year
<p>

<li>print the calendar for the given year or a specific month of a given year  online with the option to  write to a file (in either truncate or append mode)

</ol>
<P>prompts the user to enter a
year and then list the calendar for the  important dates : <p>

<ul>
<li>Requirements:<p><ul>

<li>Date class must be used in part II (application).
<li>Your implementation of those holiday function  must confront the <a href="List.txt">naming</a> requirement.


<p>
</ol><P>
<li><h3>Warnings</h3><ul>
Make sure that your coding conform the class specifications because <p>
<li>I would use my driver to test your Date class and
<li>I would use my Date.h to test your driver (main application)
</ul><p>
<li>Notes<p>
<ul>
<li> There is no need to validate the user input. 
 (Assume the users are intelligent and not try to crash your system in purpose .... which ,in general  , is not true.) <p>

<p>

<li>Click <a href="Date.exe"> here</a> for executable.<P>

<li>Here is the <a href="sample.out.txt">snapshot</a> of the sample run of the program.
<p>
<li>Here is the <a href="out.txt">output</a> file .<p>
<li><A href="CALENDAR.CPP">useful stuff</a><p>
<li><a href="cal.pdf"> How </a> to determine a Leap year and the day code of the year. <p><P>
</ul>
<li>What to submit? <p>
 you need to submit   the entire project (make sure your source code as text file is included.)  <p>
 Submit zipped folder through    COL. 
 You also have to indicate what compiler you are using in the comment field<p>

</ul>
</ul>

</ul>
